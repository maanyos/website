					Worked in a Canadian startup developing smart solutions to improve healthcare admin processes.
					<h6>Overview</h6>
					Developed a Document AI engine to extract information from medical documents, simplifying tasks
					for healthcare staff. The engine includes a multimodal transformer (image-encoder decoder model) for
					visual extraction and a post-processor using OpenAI API for cleaning, validation, and reformatting.
					<h6>Contributions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Design and implement AI engine system in Python</li>
						<li>Label datasets</li>
						<li>Train model on AWS EC2</li>
						<li>Develop evaluate procedure for engine performance</li>
						<li>Develop post processor</li>
					</ol>
					<h6>Results</h6>
					The AI engine is robust, effectively handling documents with high noise levels, handwriting,
					and information scattered across multiple pages. It achieved an accuracy of over 80% on
					client documents, significantly improving from the previous version's 60% and surpassing
					general-purpose models like GPT-4o, which achieve 55%.

					Partnered with Boeing to explore single pilot cockpit operations in commercial aircrafts.
					<h6>Overview</h6>
					Designed and developed a proof-of-concept solution for a single pilot cockpit using smart glasses
					and an automated cockpit switch system. The solution handles tasks typically performed by a
					co-pilot, such as executing checklists, error detection, and ensuring pilot alertness.
					<h6>Contributions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Engaged with Boeing engineers and pilots to understand current cockpit procedures
						</li>
						<li>Designed functionality of smart glasses and automated switches:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Overlays critical information such as checklist items and warnings in the pilot's field
								of view
							</li>
							<li>Tracks the pilot's blinking pattern and wakes them with vibrations if their eyes remain
								closed for an extended period</li>
							<li>Uses computer vision to detect errors in pilot's actions and alert them accordingly
							</li>
							<li>Automated switches execute tasks upon pilot approval while maintaining manual override
								capability as backup</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Sourced and integrated all electronic components, including a mini OLED display, vibration
							motor, motion sensor, video camera, buttons & switches, rotary motors, and
							microcontrollers</li>
						<li>Developed all functionality of smart glasses and automated switches including
							microcontroller algorithm, computer vision, and OLED display content (Yolov8, Python,
							Arduino)</li>
					</ol>
					<h6>Results</h6>
					The solution offloads lower-level tasks, such as manually flipping switches and looking down at
					cockpit instruments. This helps the pilot to focus on higher level tasks like decision making and
					monitoring the flight path, thus improving the pilot's situational awareness and flight safety.

					NUS Computer Engineering course on Real-Time Operating Systems.
					<h6>Overview</h6>
					In this project, teams are tasked with building a remote-controlled robotic car capable of
					navigating an obstacle course as quickly as possible. Each car is built using similar components,
					with the primary differentiating factor being the software and operating system developed by each
					team. The cars require essential functionalities, including playing music, flashing lights, and
					maneuvering abilities. The car uses an ESP32 for wireless control and a main microcontroller (FRDM
					KL25Z), which contains an ARM Cortex M0+ processor. This processor runs a Real-Time Operating System
					(Keil RTX), programmed with threads and interrupts in C.
					<h6>Contributions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Co-designed the OS architecture</li>
						<li>Recommended switching from HTTP to UDP protocol for control signals, reducing latency</li>
						<li>Implemented the flashing light functionality requirement</li>
						<li>Designed and procured a custom laser-cut acrylic chassis frame to enhance vehicle dynamics
						</li>
						<li>Drove the car during final obstacle course run to obtain the team's timing</li>
					</ol>
					<h6>Results</h6>
					The thoughtful design and implementation of our Real-Time Operating System led to exceptionally low
					control latency. Additionally, the joystick control system, developed by a team member, provided
					finer control over the car's movements compared to traditional button controls. This responsiveness
					and ease of control enabled our team to achieve the fastest lap time in our lab class by a
					comfortable margin.

				<div class="project-description">
					Developed robotics solutions for military applications.
					<h6>Overview</h6>
					Using robots to perform high-risk military activities, such as urban exploration, greatly lowers the
					risk exposure of soldiers and can save many lives.
					<h6>Contributions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Developed GPS-based localization capability by interfacing with the robot's onboard GPS
							module</li>
						<li>Developed a pre-exploration stage where the robot autonomously moves into the area to be
							explored </li>
						<li>Automated exploration procedure, including the transitions between localisation,
							pre-exploration, and exploration stages</li>
					</ol>
					<h6>Results</h6>
					Given the GPS coordinates of an area to explore, and the robot starting from any arbitrary location,
					it can localise itself, move into the area to explore, and begin exploration, all in one step and
					autonomously.

					Developed robotics solutions for military applications.
					<h6>Overview</h6>
					Drones are a great way to deliver small items to destinations in buildings, particularly those on
					higher floors. The addition of user assistance greatly reduces the difficulty of manoeuvering drones
					in cramped urban areas, making it accessible for soldiers to operate without extensive drone
					training.
					<h6>Contributions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Designed overall system process and structure</li>
						<li>Trained a computer vision (Yolov8 object tracking) model on building windows</li>
						<li>Integrated the computer vision model with a test drone</li>
					</ol>
					<h6>Results</h6>
					Semi-automated navigation: A soldier manually pilots a drone towards a building until the drone
					camera detects the windows (typically from 20 meters away). The soldier selects the appropriate
					destination window, and the drone autonomously flies to the window.
